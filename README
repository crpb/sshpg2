Overview
========

Keep your SSH keys GPG-encrypted!

* You will need ssh-agent running.
  If you are a console user,
  or if X session doesn't start ssh-agent for you,
  add ``ssh.bashrc`` to your ``.bashrc``.

* ``ssh-add`` is a wrapper script that, when run without arguments,
  adds your GPG-encrypted private SSH keys (``~/.ssh/*.gpg``) to the
  ssh-agent.

FAQ
===

Why don't just set passphrase in ``ssh-keygen``?
   * One passphrase for the GPG key is more manageable
     than *N* + 1 passphrases,
     especially when *N*, the number of SSH keys, is high.
   * GPG-Agent's password entry UI is prettier that SSH's one.

What does the name stand for?
   **SSH** keys protected by Gnu\ **PG**, attempt #\ **2**

How to generate all them keys for all my Hosts?

.. code-block:: sh

   # use a subdirectory for a clean ~/.ssh/
   mkdir -p ~/.ssh/gpg.d/;
   for SSHHOST in $(awk '/^Host / {print $2}'~/.ssh/config); do
      # with TOKEN %k you can use SSHHOST, with %h you will need to use
      # SSHHOSTNAME which might have twins as it can be a local ip /ö\
      # SSHHOSTNAME=$(ssh -G $SSHHOST|awk '/^hostname / {print $2}');
      SSHUSER=$(ssh -G $SSHHOST|awk '/^user / {print $2}');
      ssh-keygen -ted25519 -f ~/.ssh/gpg.d/$SSHUSER@$SSHHOST.ed25519 -C  $SSHUSER@$SSHHOST-$USER -P "";
   done

And how the food could i encrypt them with ease?

.. code-block:: sh

   # This could already be done during the generation tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
   cd ~/.ssh/gpg.d/
   ls |grep -v \.pub  |xargs gpg --encrypt-files <GPGKEYID>
   ls |grep -v \.pub -v \.gpg |xargs rm

How could i put all them keys on the correct Host?

.. code-block:: sh

   cd ~/.ssh/gpg.d; for PUB in *.pub; do
      RHOST=${PUB%.ed25519.pub};
      echo $RHOST; #just so we know..
      cat ~/.ssh/gpg.d/$PUB |ssh -o BatchMode=yes -T $RHOST "cat | tee -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys";
   done

And how do i use those Keys with ``IdentitiesOnly=yes``?
   ``IdentityFile %d/.ssh/gpg.d/%r@%k.ed25519`` will work even w/o the actual
   key aslong as there is a .pub file.
